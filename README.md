### Disclaimer
* The purposal here is to document a trajectory of a developer till "1Z0-829 OCD" approval.
* Describing and sharing experiences/materials, use this README.md as template, and document your Journey! It can help another people to understand how you got your objective.
* There will be some textbook reccomendations.
* Buying the textbooks using the links below, the author will receive a small bonus, but feel free to buy the textbooks whereever you want.
* Instead of any bonus, the main reason here is to help people, in their journey through the "Java Certification".
* Below, you will find courses suggestions. Yes, I did those. However...
  * I reccomend to studying by textbooks. Why?
    * It is **faster**, _believe me_!
    * More **complete**;
    * 100% **trusthfull** data;
    * The authors are _**"real experts in the exam content/questions"**_, and They:
      * keep in touch with the exam 100% of time (to update the textbooks)
      * take the exam periodically, they _get their hands dirty_!
      * keep in touch with Oracle, to clarify aspects about the exam.


### Exam Toughness
* Oracle Java exams are considered "one of the most" tough in the software-development-world...
* Listen carefully, the words _"in 2 months you will pass"_. "1Z0-829 OCD" approval, can take some time. Think realystically.
* _Professional experience_ can **(maybe will)** make shorter or longer your time-preparation. Thus, be aware 
  _"real-world"_ or _"Industrial Experience"_ can help you **A LOT**. 
* However, it is necessary to admit that longer time-preparation may be means that _more reviews, more questions,_ 
  and consequently, a more _**consistent knowledge**_.
* [1Z0-829 OCD](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-17-developer/pexam_1Z0-829) | [1Z0-819 OCD](https://education.oracle.com/cat%C3%A1logo-de-produtos-ouexam-pexam_1z0-819/pexam_1Z0-819) can be harder, because it englobes [comparison](https://www.selikoff.net/ocp11-819/):
  * Professional Programmer I (Old 1Z0-815)
  * Professional Programmer II (Old 1Z0-817)
* Time managment is crucial - Usually, no time for reviews or regrets:

| Exam Code      | Java Version | Time | Questions |
|:---------------|:---------:|:----:|:---------:|
| 1Z0-829 OCD    | 17 | 90 Minutes  | 50 |
| 1Z0-819 OCD    | 11 | 90 Minutes  | 50 |
| 1Z0-815 OCP I  | 11 | 180 Minutes | 80 |
| 1Z0-816 OCP II | 11 | 180 Minutes | 80 |

### Theory Preparation
 1. Theory Preparation:
    * Prepares the candidate for:
      * Technical interviews
      * Real Daily-Routine technical challenges:
        * Sources: TextBook + Udemy Course
 2. Strategy:
    * Code concept-proofs
    * Read textbooks (OCP Study Guide)
    * Take Udemy Course (Java SE 11 Developer 1Z0-819 OCP Course)
      * Highlight course's PDFs
      * Content divided in 8 study-blocks
    * Review weekly the PDFs after course conclusion

### Exam Preparation
1. Exam-Questions Preparation:
  * Prepares the candidate for:
    * Exam by itself
2. Simulates REAL Exam using Enthuware Studio
 * Take the Exam as the REAL one
   * Including time management
3. Correct the simulated-exams:
   * Review the right ones 
   * Corrects the mistakes
     * List ALL mistakes (they should review periodically)


### Exam Preparation Questions Mistakes
1. :recycle:Review mistakes "periodically":
   * Understand and explain for yourself, the reason of the mistakes
   * Repeat the mistaken question listed in the topic above
2. :recycle: Golden Rules:
   * Mistakes are most efficent "source" of knowledge
   * Mistakes are not a SHAME, actually they are the "precise parameters" for improvements
   * More mistakes 'done', 'understood' and 'reviewed', means more knowldge acquired, not only for the Exam, but 
     also for Professional-Life.

### Exam Execution Strategy
* **_Doubts:_** In case of doubt:
  * Avoid 'absolute' alternatives - prefer:
    * _"may be"_ instead of _"will be"_
    * _"can be"_ instead of _"must be"_
  * Check "compilation error" when possible
* **_Round 01:_** Focus in reach 68% - basic approval
  * Short-questions: Crystal clear answers
  * Mark the below questions for _Round 02_: _Check alternative answers anyway, "**better safe than sorry**"_

| Question Type | Description                |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| `Short-questions` | Doubt about the answer |
| `Long-questions`  | Doubt about the answer |
| `Long-questions`  | Crystal clear answers |

* **_Round 02:_** Focus in reach 32% - optimizing approval
    * Lastly, answer _properly_ the questions marked in round 01

### Mindset:
> Be realistic about the _**actual reason**_ for the certification, meaning... Certification must not be seen as a paper to place in your wall, on the contrary, it must be seem as a technical and complete theory preparation journey of professional improvements

> NEVER... NEVER... NEVER GIVE UP...The Journey will be hard and lonely, but keep walking, keep going... Oracle Exams claims sacrificing, but its worthwhile, you will grow up technically a lot... Enjoy the journey...

> When failing in the exam-simulations, keep going, dont "fell blue"...Keep working and, overtime, you will find the right track to reach the approval

> Before the Final Victory, a lot thinks will be fixed, rethought, adjusted and trained. When necessary CHANGE, do not keep doing the same think, if it is not working!!!
