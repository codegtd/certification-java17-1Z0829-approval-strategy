### Exam Toughness
* Oracle Java exams are considered "one of the most" tough in the software-development-world...
* Do not hear the people say "in 2 months you will pass". In the exam Java "1Z0-829 OCD", it can take more time. Think realystically.
* [1Z0-829 OCD](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-17-developer/pexam_1Z0-829) | [1Z0-819 OCD](https://education.oracle.com/cat%C3%A1logo-de-produtos-ouexam-pexam_1z0-819/pexam_1Z0-819) is much harder, because it sort of englobes [comparison](https://www.selikoff.net/ocp11-819/):
  * Professional Programmer I (Old 1Z0-815)
  * Professional Programmer II (Old 1Z0-817)
* Time is crucial point - Usually, no time for reviews or regrets:
  * 1Z0-829 OCD | 1Z0-819 OCD: 90 Minutes - 50 Questions
  * 1Z0-815 OCP-I | 1Z0-816 OCP-II: 180 Minutes - 80 Questions
* Even the OCP Study Guide Authors, [Jeanne](https://www.selikoff.net/about-jeanne/) and [Scott](https://www.selikoff.net/about-scott/), don't reach "rocket sky scores" (verified till 01-feb-2023):

   * Repeat the mistaken question listed in the topic above
2. :recycle: Golden Rules:
   * Mistakes are most efficent "source" of knowledge
   * Mistakes are not a SHAME, actually they are the "precise parameters" for improvements
   * More mistakes 'done', 'understood' and 'reviewed', means more knowldge acquired, not only for the Exam, but 
     also for Professional-Life.

### Mindset:
* Be realistic about the _**actual reason**_ for the certification, meaning... Certification must not be seen as a 
  paper to place in your wall, on the contraty, it must be seem as a technical and complete theory preparation journey for your professional life as a developer
* NEVER... NEVER... NEVER GIVE UP...
* The Journey will be hard and lonely, but keep walking, keep going...
* You won't be the first/last to work super hard to pass in the Oracle Java Exam...
* Oracle Exams claims sacrificing, but its worthwhile, you will grow up technically a lot... Enjoy the journey...
* When failing in the exam-simulations, keep going, dont "fell blue"...
* Keep working and, overtime, you will find the right track to reach the enough marks to get the approval...
* When you get upset with your failings... [whatch motivational content, like it](https://www.youtube.
  com/watch?v=YBYuDdfEnnc), and remember...If the character got his goal, overcoming all challenges, you will do the 
  same....
* Before the Final Victory, a lot thinks will be fixed/rethought/adjusted/trained, till the success. When necessary 
  CHANGE, do not keep doing the same strategy!!!
